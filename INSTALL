Getting Started
---------------
To build Clio you will need:

	* An ANSI C compiler.
	* The flex lexical analyzer generator.
	* A Berkeley-like sockets API, (Winsock will do).
	* A curses screen handling library. 
	* An OSS compatible sound library (optional).

If you don't have flex, you will find a telnet.c file in the contrib
directory which was produced by running telnet.l through flex 2.5.4 on
a SCO OpenServer 5.0.5 system. It should compile on most systems. Just
copy telnet.c to the src directory.

If your system does not have a native curses library, download and
install ncurses from your local GNU site. If ncurses doesn't support
your system, you'll need to find another curses library. For Windows,
you can use PDCurses (available on SourceForge).

If you don't have OSS, you can download it from the SGI website at
http://oss.sgi.com./projects/audiofile/. If your system is not 
supported, you can still build Clio, but without sound effects.
Under Windows, Clio uses the Win32 PlaySound() function, and doesn't
need OSS.
