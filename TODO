The Clio 'To Do' List.

These are in no particular order. Each item has been classified as
follows:

! = High priority. Things I'd really like to see done. Just because
    something is high priority, doesn't mean it will get done first. 

* = Standard. Things that will probably be done eventually...

? = Possible. Usually features that have been requested, or that I
    have thought about adding, but which I'm not really too sure about.


General
-------
? Implement macros.

* Show SV total on status line. (Needs a change to FES)

? Show TALLY and WHO count on the status line. Could use FEI.

? Colour URLs blue in log body, and yellow in headers.

* Cope with URLs that are split across lines.

? Capture the litter word and chart directions. (Needs a context code?)

? Character at a time mode when outside the game. Lets you use EDIT
  when sending mail etc. (Might need to improve ANSI emulation? Needs
  changes to URL parsing)

? Make the input buffer optional?

* 'Option unavailable' message when you quit. (FE catching the last FES)

* Timeout option.

! Improve ANSI handling, and CR handling - eg avalon-rpg.com

? User definable colour schemes.

! Don't echo passwords on the input line.

* Improved scroll back handling. (Jump to top of buffer, page at
  a time scrolling, freeze screen on scroll back).

? Split screen on scroll back.

* When you try to ATT to a new persona, and your persona slots are all
  in use, the FES command is taken as input.

* When you ATT to mobile, FES causes your prompt to scroll.

* Sometimes when snooping, the |1| is not at the start of the line.

? CTRL-V option to show command history.

? History search option.

* Escaped commands are not handled when the server is in no-echo (/N)
  mode. (Is this a server bug? - ask Richard). Should Clio always
  force /E mode?

? lines get chomped at 254 when uploading.

* A method to bind filenames to funtion keys.

* Supply the missing \n to files.

* Spurious pops on third party emotion messages. (MUD2 bug?).

* Spurious pops on STINGS. (MUD2 bug?).

* On input line, ctrl to move forward/back one word.

* Status line to show if you have a cold.


Windows
-------
* Check installation under Windows 95. (It crashes on my laptop)

? Connect options via a menu.

* Sometimes the mouse cursor appears in the Windows full screen mode,
  even though it has been disabled. (PDCurses problem)

* Sometimes there is a pause at startup, and you have to hit a key to
  get any response. (PDCurses?)

? Convert ncurses to Windows. This is a major undertaking.

* The cursor is not showing on the input line on some NT and W2K
  systems.


UNIX
----
* X Windows version with resizeable screen.

* Crashes on resize under xterm. xterm scrollbar does not work.

* Fix 'click' on sound effects under UNIX, perhaps by using a server
  to play the sounds? I'm assuming the click comes from the sound
  device being repeatedly opened and closed.

? Add support for Enlightened Sound Daemon (EsounD) under Linux.

* Improve the Makefile to handle each target (eg make linux, make os5).


Sound Effects
-------------
* Make new WAV files for:

  The "ear-shattering C/R/E/A/K" of the north tomb opening.
  The "earth-trembling G|R|O|A|N" of the west tomb opening.
  The "nerve-rendering S^C^R^E^E^C^H" of the south tomb opening.
  The "mighty (B)(O)(O)(M)" of the east tomb opening.
  The "grinding S>C>R>E>E>E" of the southeast tomb opening.
  The "vibrant G}R}A}U}N}C}H" of the southwest tomb opening.
  The "deathly S-W-I-S-H" of the northeast tomb opening.
  The "ghostly C-R-E-A-K" of the tombs closing.

  The slab in MROST starting to open with a "low, grinding noise" and
  stopping with a "low, echoing thud". (two different effects)

  Doors which "creaks slowly open".

  The "Plonk!" of the ruby eye falling out.
