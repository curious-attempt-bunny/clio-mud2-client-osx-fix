INSTALLATION

After extracting the tar file, you should have:

File		Description			Suggested Location
----		-----------			------------------
README		This file			/usr/local/lib/clio/
clio		Clio binary			/usr/local/bin/
clio.6		Manual, nroff format		/usr/local/man/man.6/
clio.man	Clio manual, processed format	-
bl		Script for British Legends	/usr/local/lib/clio/
mud2		Script for MUD2.com		/usr/local/lib/clio/
mudii		Script for MUDII.co.uk		/usr/local/lib/clio/
purgelogs	Script to delete old logs	/usr/local/lib/clio/

Copy these files into the suggested locations, or to wherever you
install programs on your system. The clio.man file can be used for
those systems without the document processing tools. (nroff and
friends)

The shell scripts in /usr/local/lib/clio/ illustrate the use of
environment variables with Clio to enable autologin.  They should
be copied to your $(HOME)/bin directory and then edited to include
the correct account and password details.

The purgelogs script can be run by hand, or via cron, to clean up
old log files.

IMPORTANT: These files *MUST* be readable and executable only by you.
If other people can read or run these files they will be able to
login to MUD2 with your account.

  % cd
  % cd bin
  % cp /usr/local/lib/clio/mud2 .
  % chmod 700 clio
  % vi clio


AUTOLOGIN SECURITY

As noted above, the use of variables in shell scripts to record your
account name and password is a potential security risk. If another 
user can read the shell script they will see your password.

The other method of supplying account information to clio is to use
the -a, -b, -c and -p flags. However, this method is even less secure
as your account details will be visible to other users via the ps(1)
command.

Of course, Clio could store the account information in an encrypted
form, but then you would have to enter a password to access THAT
information, negating the advantage of autologin...
