Changes to Clio from version 1.7 to version 1.8
-----------------------------------------------
* /E now works for non-MUD2 muds too.

* You can now use the /P (change password) and /S (set timeout)
  commands when in the game, without Clio clobbering them with
  a FES command. Similarly, wizzes can now use /BR.

* Wizzes who use /DI no longer lose their dreamword.

* Wrapped the Clio log file style sheet in HTML comments to 
  prevent it being rendered by non-css aware browsers.

* Tiny cosmetic change to the CSS layout for the <PRE> element.

* The default scroll back buffer is now 300 lines.

* Changed house messages to use white on blue under the MUD2.com
  colour scheme to match the system defaults.

* Changed the snow messages to use white on green under the
  MUDII.co.uk colour scheme to match the system defaults.

* Changed the snow message on the status line to reflect the
  MUDII.co.uk colour scheme.

* The post-storm rainbow now gets its correct colour coding.

* Added a META HTTP-EQUIV tag for Content-Type to the Clio
  log output.



Changes to Clio from version 1.6 to version 1.7
-----------------------------------------------
* When uploading a file, any tab characters are now converted to 
  a single space. Previously they were just ignored.

* Fixed a problem with the wiz /DIR command messing up the status
  line.

* Fixed a problem where Clio sometimes didn't detect you quitting
  the game, resulting in your score still being displayed when
  you arrived back at the Option: prompt.

* Replaced the MUD2 champagne sound effect (1324.wav) with a less
  wimpy POP! sound.

* Changed the way Clio names log files to use a hierarchical
  structure including the year and month. The new format is
  host\year\month\day-HHMMSS.html. Eg, a file named:

        Logs\MUD2.com\20011201-134530.html

  under the old system would now be named:

        Logs\MUD2.com\2001\December\01-134530.html

  If you have a lot of old log files, and you'd like to rename
  them to the new format, you'll find a little utility at
  http://www.wabe.org.uk/clio/clogs.exe which will do it for
  you. UNIX users can do the same thing with a couple of lines
  of Perl. This is left as an exercise for the reader.

* Excised the remaining references to 'Wireplay' from the
  documentation files, and replaced them with 'MUDII.co.uk'.

* Added a -f option to allow the base folder for log files to
  be specified. This is useful if you connect through a telnet
  proxy.

  Eg:  clio -f MUD2.com telnet-proxy.example.com

  You can also use this to combine all your logs into one folder

  Eg:   clio /F "My MUD2 Logs" MUD2.com
        clio /F "My MUD2 Logs" MUDII.co.uk

  If the -f option is not specified, the host name will be used
  as the folder name.

* Clio no longer filters out input characters with the 8th bit set.
  This is to allow the use of accented characters with non-English 
  language MUDs.

* Formalised the fact that Clio's internal character set is the
  ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) alphabet.

  This allows Clio to display text from MUDs written in Afrikaans,
  Albanian, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Faroese,
  Finnish, French, Galician, German, Icelandic, Irish Gaelic,
  Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Rhaeto-Romanic, Scottish Gaelic,
  Spanish, Swahili, and Swedish!

  (Thanks to Pablo Ruiz for access to his Spanish language MUD
  while testing this - http://eutherpe.org/)

* Added screen-handling support for systems which do not support
  ISO-8859-1 directly. Clio can read a code page mapping file,
  specified via the new /M option, which describes how to translate
  the ISO-8859-1 character set to the native system character set.

  Eg:
        clio /M cp850 example.com

* Created code page map files for IBM 850, IBM 437, and ASCII.

* Added HTML entity name support to the logging code for all
  ISO-8859-1 characters.

* Fixed a tiny bug in catch/throw handling code in MUDFREND mode.

* Updated the Windows Help file, and UNIX man page.



Changes to Clio from version 1.5 to version 1.6
-----------------------------------------------
* Clio is now open source software, and is distributed under the
  MIT licence. The Clio source code is available from SourceForge.
  (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/clio-mud2/)

* Improved interaction with telnet servers that refuse to negotiate
  telnet GO AHEAD suppression.

* Fixed a problem with Clio repeatedly attempting to enter client mode
  even though it was in client mode already. If this happened when in 
  non-echo (/N) mode, you could get stuck in a loop, and not be able
  to recover (with /E). 

* Tidied up the UNIX man page, and fixed numerous typos.

* Small portability fixes for Sun Solaris 8.

* The Clio version number is now logged as part of the HTML
  "generator" string.

* CTRL-R will now do a full screen redraw, for UNIX systems where
  output from other commands has messed up the display.

* Fixed a possible cause of the occasional pauses when starting
  under Windows. (Doesn't seem to have made much difference, 
  though...<grumble>)

* Backspace characters are now correctly handled when creating
  log files.

* Clio is now slightly less egotistical when creating HTML log
  files...

* The MUSE copyright notice is now only added to log footers if
  the log is from a MUD2 site.



Changes to Clio from version 1.4 to version 1.5
-----------------------------------------------
* More improvements to URL parsing.

* Fixed a problem with the default colour not always being set when
  using the 'MUDII.co.uk' (nee 'Wireplay') colour scheme.

* Added support for another 24 function keys, F13 to F36. These are
  usually mapped to SHIFT-F1 - SHIFT-F12 and CTRL-F1 - CTRL-F12. You
  can define them in you clio.ini or .cliorc file as normal.

  Eg: F13=get treasure
      F25=drop treasure

* Added the ability to upload files. To read from a file, type the 
  full path name (Eg C:\Windows\Desktop\My Quest.txt) on the input
  line, and then press CTRL-Y. There is an artificial delay after 
  each line, to avoid flooding the MUD2 server. File upload only
  works for wizzes.

* Improved handling of ANSI colour codes from non-MUD2 MUDs. Clio is 
  now more tolerant of the mangled ANSI codes produced by some MUDs.



Changes to Clio from version 1.3 to version 1.4
-----------------------------------------------
* Cosmetic changes to the status line display when not in client mode.

* Clio now takes full advantage of the 30 line console presented by
  some versions of Linux, and of 43 and 50 line MS-DOS consoles.

* Fixed a problem with bold colours and highlighted URLs when running
  in ANSI mode.

* Clio now jumps back to the bottom of the scroll back buffer if a
  command is entered.

* The DELETE key now functions as it should. (It used to function like
  the BACKSPACE key.

* Increased the size of the command history to hold the last forty
  commands entered. Improved history handling of blank commands.



Changes to Clio from version 1.2 to version 1.3
-----------------------------------------------
* Complete re-write of the HTML logging code:

  . Clio now uses cascading style sheets instead of <FONT> tags
    for colouring text.

  . Colours are now logged from ANSI mode as well as client mode.

  . Less gratuitous use of &nbsp; making the HTML more readable, 
    and the log files a lot smaller.

  . URLs that appear in log files are now clickable.

  . All HTML produced by Clio now conforms to the "HTML 4.01 Strict"
    specification, and passes the W3C validation tests for both HTML
    and CSS.

* Fixed a problem with % signs not displaying.

* Added a caption to the Windows title bar.

* Added a work-around for the missing local sound effects.
  (The cannon, the mine flooding, and the dragon's hawumph).

* Added auto login support for initial username and password. Two new
  command line flags, -b and -c, supply the login name and password.

  Eg: clio -b mud -a p00000011 -p secret mud2.com

  The -c option is only needed if there is a password for the login
  name.

  Eg: clio -b mud -c mudpasswd -a p00000011 -p secret mud2.com

  There are two new environment variables, CLIOLUSER and CLIOLPASS
  which can be used in place of the command line options. They
  function similarly to the CLIOUSER and CLIOPASS variables. Eg:

    set CLIOLUSER=mud
    set CLIOUSER=p00000011
    set CLIOPASS=secret
    clio mud2.com

* Improved parsing of URLs. Trailing '.' is now not included.

* Improved the handling of 'Wireplay' mode colours.

* Added sound effects support to the Linux and UNIX versions. You will
  need to have the Open Sound System installed. This comes as standard
  on recent version of Linux and UnixWare. For SCO OpenServer, you
  will need the sound drivers from SCO's ftp site.
  (ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/drivers/OSR505/audio/)

  I'm not sure of the current situation re OpenBSD and OSS, and I'd
  welcome any feedback on this if there is actually anyone running
  Clio under OpenBSD with sound.

* telnet:// URLs are now coloured and logged like http:. So are wais:
  and gopher: (ask your parents....).



Changes to Clio from version 1.1 to version 1.2
-----------------------------------------------
* Clearing the screen now resets the scroll-back buffer to the end.

* Fixed a buffer overflow in telnet option negotiation.

* Added support for sound effects under Windows. See the readme.txt
  file in C:\Program Files\Clio MUD2 Client\Sounds\ for details.

* CTRL-W will now toggle between the different levels of sound
  effects.

* Added a -q flag to set the initial sound effects level. The default
  value is 2.

      clio -q 0 mud2.com    # Quiet - no sound effects.
      clio -q 1 mud2.com    # Standard sound effects only.
      clio -q 2 mud2.com    # Extended sound effects.

* General overhaul of the way Clio handles the weather. Fixed a
  problem with weather description jumping between RAIN and STORM
  if you are outside during a storm.

* CLOUD is now displayed in dark grey if storm clouds are gathering.

* Expanded the usage message if you run clio with no parameters.

* URLs starting "https://" are now treated similarly to "http://"
  and "ftp://".

* Minor changes to the layout of the log file. Brightened up the
  colours when logging in html.

* Updated the Windows Help file, and UNIX man page.



Changes to Clio from version 1.0 to version 1.1
-----------------------------------------------
* Fixed problem with creeping prompt in CONVERSE mode.

* The ESC key will now clear the input line, similar to CTRL-U.

* URLs appearing at the end of spoken comments no longer mess up the
  screen colours.

* Options can now be specified using the standard DOS '/' character, 
  in addition to the standard UNIX '-' character. Option letter are
  now case-insensitive.

  Eg: clio -a acc -p passwd mud2.com
      clio /A acc /P passwd mud2.com

* When Clio is run from a DOS prompt, the window colours are now
  correctly reset when the program ends.

* Added a -w flag to tell Clio to use the default Wireplay colour
  scheme instead of the default MUD2.com colour scheme.

  Eg: clio -w wp34.wireplay.net

* Clio now has a scroll back buffer to allow previous screen output
  to be reviewed. Use the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys to scroll
  through the buffer. CTRL-A will jump directly to the end of the 
  buffer.

* The size of the scroll back buffer can be increased with the -s 
  option. The default size is 200 lines. Large buffers will use up
  more memory, and may cause slow scrolling.

  Eg: clio -s 400 mud2.com

* Updated the Windows Help file, and UNIX man page.
